# Avengers Maze - Gameplay Guide

Welcome to Avengers Maze! Navigate through a fog-covered maze, defeat villains, and find the exit to claim victory.

## How to Play

### 1. Select Your Hero

Choose from four Marvel heroes, each with unique abilities:

| Hero | Health | Attack | Vision | Special Abilities |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Hulk** | 150 | 25 | 2 | Wall Smash, Ground Pound |
| **Falcon** | 100 | 18 | 4 | Recon, Glide |
| **Hawkeye** | 90 | 22 | 3 | Trick Arrow, Eagle Eye |
| **Stretch** | 85 | 15 | 3 | Squeeze, Long Reach |

### 2. Navigate the Maze

- Use **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** to move
- The maze is shrouded in fog - explore to reveal tiles
- Your **Vision** stat determines how far you can see

### 3. Defeat All Villains

You'll encounter three types of enemies:

- **Chitauri Soldier** 👽 - Low health, low damage
- **Hydra Agent** 🐍 - Medium health, medium damage  
- **Ultron Drone** 🤖 - Medium health, high damage

> **Important:** The exit only appears after all villains are defeated!

### 4. Combat

When you step on an enemy tile, combat begins:

- **Attack** - Deal normal damage
- **Special Attack** - Deal 1.5x damage

Combat is **simultaneous** - both you and the enemy deal damage each round. It's possible for both to fall in the same round!

### 5. Use Your Abilities

Press **1** or **2** to activate abilities (when not in combat):

| Hero | Ability 1 | Ability 2 |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Hulk | 💥 **Wall Smash** - Destroy a wall | 🌍 **Ground Pound** - Stun nearby enemies |
| Falcon | 🔭 **Recon** - Reveal large area | 🕊️ **Glide** - Fly over one wall |
| Hawkeye | 🎯 **Trick Arrow** - Ranged attack | 👁️ **Eagle Eye** - Reveal all enemies |
| Stretch | 🌀 **Squeeze** - Pass through a wall | 🤚 **Long Reach** - Attack from distance |

### 6. Find the Exit

Once all villains are defeated:
- The exit 🚪 appears with a green glow
- Walk to the exit to win!

## Tips

- **Hulk** is great for beginners - high health and can smash through walls
- **Falcon** has the best vision - spot enemies from far away
- **Hawkeye's Eagle Eye** reveals all enemies instantly - use it early!
- **Stretch** can squeeze through walls to take shortcuts

Good luck, Avenger! 🦸
